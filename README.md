# Tensorflow implementation of Fully Convolutional Networks

Tensorflow implementation of [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (FCNs)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html).

This repo is based on https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow and updated to `tensorflow-1.0` and `python3.5`. Some code was modified to make it easier for myself to understand.  


Being updated.
