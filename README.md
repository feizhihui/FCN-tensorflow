# Tensorflow implementation of Fully Convolutional Networks

This repo is followed by https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow and updated to `tensorflow-1.0` and `python3.5`. Some code was modified to make it easier for myself to understand.  

FCN paper [link](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html)

Being updated.
